The raw folder contains the raw ratings from the primary (AllBlocks...csv) dataset, rater generalization 1 dataset (study1_abstract_raw.csv), rater generalization 2 datset (study3_abstract_ratings.csv) and far generalization dataset (study1_object_raw.csv).

The JRT.R script transforms the raw ratings into Judge Response Theory (Myszkowski, 2019) theta scores and outputs the datasets found in the JRT folder.
